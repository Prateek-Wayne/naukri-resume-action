# Naukri Resume Action 📄

A GitHub Action to automatically upload your resume to Naukri.com, keeping your
profile fresh and active—no manual intervention needed! 🚀

## Features ✨

- 🔄 **Scheduled uploads:** Keep your profile active automatically
- 🔐 **Secure credential handling:** Uses GitHub Secrets
- 📂 **Multiple resume support:** Support for multiple resume files
- 🖱️ **Manual trigger:** Instantly update your profile

## Important Note ⚠️

**This action requires a self-hosted runner** in a region where Naukri.com is
accessible. For example, you can use an AWS EC2 instance in the Mumbai region.
GitHub-hosted runners (typically in US/EU) may not work due to Naukri API
restrictions.
